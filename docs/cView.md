# 8. Calendars

This function allows the visualization of the time series of scintillation monitoring data through a general perspective. Generating calendars mainly for the averaged daily value of the S4 index.

 - We have two variations of this function: 

    1. **Calendar View:** generates calendars indicating the average value of s4 on each day; 

    1. **Calendar time interval view:** generates calendars indicating the daily average and standard deviation of total S4 only in the time interval indicated by the user.

*Gray cells indicate absence of data*
